#include <stdio.h>

/*
Which one of the following statements is not equivalent to the other two (assuming that the loop bodies are the same)?

(a) while (i < 10){}

(b) for(; i < 10;){}

(c) do {} while (i < 10);

gues:

c is not the same, it is because the first iteration will always happend, while the first iteration on the a -b cases depend on the i value
